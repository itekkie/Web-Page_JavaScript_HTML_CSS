## `The UFOs analysis summary`	

The main design drawback of the web page is there is no a button to clean chosen data and apply new user filter. 

Also, it would be great to develope several further things.
Firstly, the filters don't not show any wrong user inputs. So, it should be improved. 

Secondly, to visualize data of UFOs, it's necessary to add map of sightings with different pop up details as when sightings were and how.

Finally, that is necessary to add summary some table with total shape, colors, states and countries where UFOs were appeared.
